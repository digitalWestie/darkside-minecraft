This project is a process for importing and exploring topographical maps of the Moon in the popular game Minecraft.

==================

The .world files can be opened by the program 'worldpainter'. To play them in minecraft, you must first go to: 

 *File -> Export -> Minecraft Map*

Alternatively, you can try importing the images yourself from worldpainter by going to:

 *File -> Import -> Height map*
